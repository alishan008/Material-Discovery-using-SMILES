# Material-Discovery-using-SMILES

Progress in the application of machine learning (ML) to Chemistry has been rapid. A decade ago, the method was mainly of interest to those in computer science departments, but more recently ML tools have been developed that show significant potential across wide areas of drug and material discovery.

A crucial part of machine learning for chemistry is finding ways to represent the molecule as input to the machine learning algorithm. A new representation, that of encoded bonds, helps models trained on smaller molecules to make predictions for larger molecules. This use of physical chemistry theory with computer and information science techniques in application to a range of descriptive and prescriptive problems in the field of chemistry and related molecular fields has paved a way for Cheminformatics.

Cheminformatics plays a key role in maintaining and accessing enormous amount of chemical data (generated by the chemist) by using appropriate databases. It is the application of information technology to help chemists investigate new problems, organize, analyse, and understand scientific data in the development of novel compounds, materials and processes.

One such step has been the development of the SMILES system. The simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) is a specification in the form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings. SMILES strings can be imported by most molecule editors for conversion back into two-dimensional drawings or three-dimensional models of the molecules.

Our model is trained on the dataset sourced from ‘Expert in the loop IBM’. As the website states:

>*“Expert-in-the-Loop AI (EITL AI) for Polymer Discovery data set comprises of cyclic lactones that are adjudicated as suitable candidates for further experimental investigation. Experiment includes synthesis and characterization of the polymer materials. Adjudication accounts for the expert-level judgement about the practicality of the lactone synthesis (expectation of the low cost, short synthetic route, and high yield) and utilization as a monomer (no side-reactions, reasonable reactivity under polymerization conditions).”*

The project is a Flask app that classifies SMILES notations of polymers into ‘accept’ or ‘reject’ for further experimental investigation that can accelerate material discovery. In this project, we accept multi line input of SMILES notations and validate the entries using a WebAssembly (WASM) file, compiled from Rust source code, and a two-way communication channel between JavaScript and Wasm. More details about how this is achieved can be found on this article written by the author, link is given at the end of the document. Multiple polymers can be entered in the text box with each line containing one.

As our project accepts unlimited lines of input, it is important that all of them are validated and exceptions are thrown for ones that don’t.  Therefore, a line counter that indicated the line number is placed right next to the textarea element. This helps in easily identifying the entries that don’t pass the validation as can be seen below:

Once all the entries are validated, the submit button enables and all the entries are fitted on the Machine Learning model and classified into either ‘accept’ or ‘reject’. The output is presented on a HTML table.

The whole project is deployed on Microsoft Azure. Azure DevOps was used to build and push the image of the GitHub repository to Azure Container Registry (ACR). Further, the web app was built by sourcing the image from ACR.

As we're dealing with SMILES strings here, this can't be treated like a regular string, and we need a special package RDKit that helps transform SMILES string into a number of values about that compound. For the purposes of this project, we derived molecular weight, the MolLogP, number of rotatable bonds, and heavy atom count of the molecule to be used for fitting the machine learning model on.
